            <h1 class="actualtext"> Hello!</h1>
            <img src="fumo.png" class="img2" width="100" height="100"/>
            <p class="actualtext2"> Thank you for visiting! This is my website! <br>
             <br> If you're on mobile then I feel sorry for you, please get on computer as soon as possible so you don't have to suffer any more reading this goofy website. Though if you're on PC then all I have to say is that I think it the site is pretty well decorated though the code could probably be improved. <br>
             <br> Anyhow, this website will include some contents regarding me as well as my portfolio. <br>
             <br> In case of any inquiries you may scroll down and find my contact info.
            </p>

            <h1 class="actualtextheader2"> Why?</h1>
            <p class="actualtext3"> Because why not. <br>
             <br> In all seriousness, quite literally because why not. Having a website is <i>free</i> and people should take advantage of that. <br>
             <br> Besides being both fun to do, even if you decide to go with wordpress or anything like that (in my case I manually coded this website) it's still worth the time and builds your portfolio, no matter how shitty your website is. <br>
             <br> I more or less made this website for fun, and I had a lot of it even when debugging frustrating things such as alignment for text, images, especially frustrations with managing relative position (I already regret using it as my basis), as well as to make a platform for my own information and get some experience. <strong> And you should too.</strong>
            </p>

            <h1 class="actualtextheader3"> What's with the theming?</h1>
            <p class="actualtext4"> Like I said, this is a <i> fun</i> project (portfolio on the side). <br>
                <br> So naturally, I decided to just make the theming I like. Makes it so I don't have to worry about hunting adequate images plus I get to look at something I like (Suwako gang for ever.)
              <br> <br> I may make a second website with more professional asthetics however that will be further ahead, right now I am content with this as is.
              <br> <br> Do not expect consistency on this website as I am still experimenting with different ideas, both visually and code wise to find what's best.
