            <h1 class="header2"> About Me</h1>
            <p class="textagain"> Hello, I am Military Boi. I'm 15 years old. I am also the creator of this website, definitely not the youngest person
                to make a website like this but definitely also not the oldest. <br> <br>
                Anyhow, I feel strong about our modern-day technologies and want to invest more time in them. I love this area and will 
                definitely get a job in it, however I am still unsure what specifically, however I feel Software Engineering or 
                Security Engineering are out calling for me, haha.
                <br> <br>
                When it comes to school I'm not a straight A student (as a matter of fact grades here are 1 through 5, 5 being the highest)
                though I'm not a "just passing" student either. I get reasonable grades and aim to improve myself whenever I can, though 
                some stuff, like PE class, I just find bullshit since there's very little I can do to recover my grade. I'm a fast learner
                though I don't study as much as I should. Depending on my mood I may study or, for example like I am right now, continue 
                coding this website, play games, continue stuff I've left, million and one possibilities. Though some days my brain just 
                feels like doing nothing. <br> <br>
                I am especially dedicated to topics and things I love, while I may get a 3 or a 4 in a test for something like Portuguese,
                however in subjects, such as Physics and Chemistry (they're joined together), I will usually get a high grade. At one point 
                I got a 100%. Another example would be, quite evidently, this website! <br> <br>
                I am more introverted and, as any introvert, I'm unhinged online. IRL, while I may look unapprochable or that I'm angry
                (usually because of my default expression) I don't mind being approached and usually enjoy a good conversation, especially 
                regarding real life stuff, hanging out with people I like and just having a good time, however my temper isn't great and 
                I don't like being pushed around.
                <br> <br>
                As for hobbies, I prefer things on the online spectrum (however I'm not against IRL stuff, sometimes I even wish I could 
                do them more), playing games like Roblox, Minecraft, Halo, Arma3, Killing Floor 2, Touhou Project, Far Cry 5, Ready or Not 
                and a few other titles, though sometimes my brain doesn't feel like picking any game and I just find myself staring into my 
                laptop's screen, listening to music, watching youtube or endlessly opening and closing apps in hopes of finding something to
                satisfy my brain for the day. <br> <br>
                I feel especially strong towards Roblox and the Touhou Project. While I do not engage with the community for the latter, I do in Roblox,
                more especifically joining <abbr title="Secure, Contain, Protect: Foundation">SCPF</abbr> groups and helping out (as of the 
                time of writing I hold the position of O5 Councilor for the Ethics Committee). <br> <br> 
                Anyways that's all, thanks for reading! Have a nice day/afternoon/night! ðŸ™‚
